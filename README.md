# IntrusionDetection

The objective of the project is to succesfully detect the intruder within the scene using just python and opencv library.

## Data
![picture alt](http://via.placeholder.com/200x150 "Title is optional")

The video which we have worked on has the following characteristics:
* 12  frame/s  (total  duration is about 41 secs)
* 320x240  pixels
* 8 bit/pixel (256 gray levels)
* The sequence is compressed by the Radius Cinepak CODEC.

Moreover, it is worth pointing out that the scene is static and this is what allows to extract the beackground via interpolation.

### Description
Essentially in the video, there is just a single person, moving around the room and towards the end takes an object (a book) and replaces with another.


First of all, it is worth pointing out that the captured scene is static (the camera does not move) which allows to extract the background via interpolation.
